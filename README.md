# Catchup! v2 MERN Stack app 

## Overview

##### Deployed Link: (https://utbc-catch-up.herokuapp.com/)

The CatchUp! app allows users to create, share and join customized map groups.

Users login using their Facebook profile.

When creating a group, the user is automatically added to an array within that group using a userID that Facebook provides.

Joining a group adds userID to that group as well.

Once in a group you can use the Chat feature to message members of the group. The chat box identifies the user messages based on user name taken from 
Facebook and stored in our database.

The map uses your geolocation and plots you on the map. Pin is identifed using your user name in our database.



CatchUp is a full stack web application using the MERN stack.
Additional technologies used are Firebase, Bootstrap, Google Maps Platform.
